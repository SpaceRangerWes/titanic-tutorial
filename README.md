## Let's Start
Before you begin with Kaggle, it is a good idea to get used to some Machine Learning (ML), Python, library, and Kaggle operations. We will be using Python (hopefully of the Python34 or higher flavor) and Apache Spark. Because the simple databricks platform is not available unless we pay for it, I will be analyzing the cost of forcing Apache Spark on the whole team. It is absolutely essential that you understand how to use Python, Jupyter, and Pandas DataFrames.

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python is a great place to start learning how we can put it all together. Read up on the tutorial and Random Forests and try to implement your own version in either Pandas or Apache Spark.
