We would like the ability to keep the dimensions and feature headers of that schema. Spark 1.6 has finally included the magic that is Pandas' Dataframes. These are essentially a database table but have built in operations (easily usable with numpy), dataflow optimizations, and easy data exploration.\n\n#### SQLContext\n[SQLContext](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SQLContext) is the main entry point for Spark SQL functionality. A SQLContext can be used create DataFrame, register DataFrame as tables, execute SQL over tables, cache tables, and read parquet files. The SQLContext takes a [SparkContext](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext) as a parameter and is in a manner of speaking a child of SparkContext.\n```python\ntrain_data_df = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').options(header='true',inferSchema='true').load('/FileStore/tables/libwrcg41471805568157/train.csv')\n```\nThis code generates a dataframe by generating a SQLContext. We pass the context some options that inform the Context a header row exists in our CSV and to automatically infer our datatypes. We then load these files from a file I have uploaded to my Databricks Community Edition workspace.\n\nLet's [check the schema](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.sql.html?highlight=printschema#pyspark.sql.DataFrame.printSchema) it has inferred and see if we agree with Spark's assumptions.","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":1.471992123252E12,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"nuid":"222e92ec-2694-475e-ac90-3e6bcf725453"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":338688711146070,"guid":"fd061507-566e-42be-a450-a14d4daa2075","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":1.0,"command":"train_data_df = (sqlContext\n                 .read\n                 .format('com.databricks.spark.csv')\n                 .options(header='true', inferSchema='true')\n                 .load('/FileStore/tables/libwrcg41471805568157/train.csv'))\ntrain_data_df.cache()\ntrain_data_df.printSchema()","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":{"type":"html","data":"<div class=\"ansiout\">root\n |-- PassengerId: integer (nullable = true)\n |-- Survived: integer (nullable = true)\n |-- Pclass: integer (nullable = true)\n |-- Name: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Sex: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Age: double (nullable = true)\n |-- SibSp: integer (nullable = true)\n |-- Parch: integer (nullable = true)\n |-- Ticket: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Fare: double (nullable = true)\n |-- Cabin: string (nullable = true)\n |-- Embarked: string (nullable = true)\n\n</div>","arguments":{},"addedWidgets":{},"removedWidgets":[]},"errorSummary":"<span class=\"ansired\">NameError</span>: name &apos;dislay&apos; is not defined","error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":1.47199212387E12,"submitTime":1.471992123273E12,"finishTime":1.471992124494E12,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"barChart","width":"660","height":"auto","xColumns":["Fare"],"yColumns":["Age"],"pivotColumns":[],"pivotAggregation":"sum","customPlotOptions":{"histogram":[{"key":"bins","value":"1"}],"barChart":[{"key":"grouped","value":true},{"key":"stacked","value":false},{"key":"100_stacked","value":false}]},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"nuid":"cfa0ebee-d677-4698-b400-1a6c92cfce0d"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":338688711146072,"guid":"1f2327a3-e53e-42fd-a460-d2d888c97a57","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":2.0,"command":"%md\n## What Happens Now?\nThere are several steps in the workflow for creating information out of data. Remember that data and information are not synonymous. Information is data in a comprehensible context. Big Data is by definition incomprehensible at a human level. It is not information that we can consume until that data is processed, cleaned, analyized, and visualized. Our understanding comes from regressions, models, statistics, and charting.\n\nCurrently we are dealing with raw data. Let's do some exploration on our new Dataframe to see what we are dealing with.\n\n#### Data Exploration\nThis is the first step we want to take before we start doing any pre-processing.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nData exploration will allow us to ask the questions of what steps we want to take to clean our data and to normalize our data. Maybe some features are missing in a few data objects. Maybe a date in one object is in a different format than in another object (i.e. 2016/08/22 vs August 22nd, 2016). These are serious issues that we need to address so that when we start doing some analysis, we can compare values to one-another. This process in particular is called Entity Resolution.\n\nIn Databricks notebook, all we need to do is call `display(dataframe)`. Super easy, right?\nThis will show us by default a table printout of a prefix of our full dataframe.
